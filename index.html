    <meta name="description" content=" I'm not wearing hockey pads. I'm not wearing hockey pads. Does it come in black? Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. Swear to me! I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the people of Gotham. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread. I'm not wearing hockey pads. It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me. Does it come in black? Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages. Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.">
